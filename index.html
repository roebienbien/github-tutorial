          Git is a DevOps tool used for source code management. It is a free and open-source version control system used to
          handle small to very large projects efficiently. Git is used to tracking changes in the source code, enabling
          multiple developers to work together on non-linear development. Linus Torvalds created Git in 2005 for the
          development of the Linux kernel.
